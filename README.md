# ML-Project-CNN

Our project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes in images of pokemon and classifies them into two categories. We chose to do this because we wanted to learn about CNNs and understand how each part of it works. We believe that to understand 
something well, we need hands-on experience so we chose to build a small model using Keras, a python library for creating neural networks, and to train it with a dataset of pokemon images. We chose this dataset because we thought it would make the project
more interesting and less formal. The dataset we found had 568 images for training and 124 images for testing. We had to convert the pictures into .csv file formats and then trained our model.
